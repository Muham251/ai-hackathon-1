# Chapter 2: Cognitive Planning with LLMs

- The role of LLMs as a "reasoning engine" for robots.
- Tutorial: Prompt engineering techniques to make an LLM translate a task into a machine-readable plan (a sequence of ROS 2 actions).
- Example: Converting `{action: "find", object: "red block"}` into a plan like `[{navigate: "table"}, {detect: "red_block"}]`.
