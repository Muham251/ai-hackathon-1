## Prompt

My setup is complete. I will provide my first command in the next turn.specs/module-1.spec.mdmkdir specs

## Response snapshot

I will create a `specs` directory and then create the file `module-1.spec.md` inside it.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created the initial specification file for Module 1.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run or added in this step.
- 📁 Files: Created `specs/module-1.spec.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User to provide content for the specification or next steps.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully created the directory and the spec file based on the template.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): None.
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Initial setup.
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
